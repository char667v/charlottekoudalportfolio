<p>I am a multimedia design student in my 3rd semester at KEA, with a lifelong passion for art and design. Over the years, I have developed skills in both traditional and digital design methods.
  My experience spans various projects, where I have learned to create visual solutions that capture the essence of a brand and solve user problems. I strive to combine aesthetics and functionality in my designs.
  I am seeking an internship where I can explore new techniques and gain practical experience while challenging the boundaries of design to deliver meaningful and valuable solutions.</p>
